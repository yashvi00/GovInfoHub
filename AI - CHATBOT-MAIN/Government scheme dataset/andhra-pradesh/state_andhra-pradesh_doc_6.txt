All the beneficiary patients must provide bank account and Aadhaar card details at the time of discharge. In case a bank account is not provided, then the money would be credited into their relative’s bank account. The authorities have already completed all arrangements in the wake of the Chief Minister’s directive to ensure there are no hurdles.

AP govt. has also decided to start Nadu Nedu Scheme on 26th December 2019 to develop all the Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centres and Area Hospitals. Ambulances will also be provided to the hospitals where there are no Ambulances. The doctors in all government hospitals should rise to the expectations of the poor patients as AP govt. spends huge amounts on govt. hospitals for welfare of poor patients.
