Now Aapunar Apun Ghar Scheme 2019 is the extension of the previous running Apun Ghar Scheme. This new Aapunar Apun Ghar Scheme is available for all citizens while the previous scheme was applicable only to state govt. employees. 

I started receiving many requests to extend #ApunGhar. I would have considered myself very fortunate if I could fulfil the dreams of each & every citizen to own a house. 
I finally announce pride & satisfaction, that our Government will launch the #AapunarApunGhar scheme. pic.twitter.com/kuL7Cly3VN
