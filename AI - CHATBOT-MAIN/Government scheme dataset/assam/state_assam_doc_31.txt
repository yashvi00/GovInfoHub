The state government of Assam has announced a new crop loan scheme for the farmers in the state in its 2017-18 budget. The “Zero Interest Crop Loan Scheme” will be launched soon for the farmers under which they can avail a crop loan of up to Rs. 1 Lakh at 0% interest rates. Through the Zero Interest Crop Loan Scheme, the state government aims to encourage the farmers to avail loans against the backdrop of low credit flow in the state.

Under the proposed scheme, the state government would offer 100% subvention on interest of crop loans of up to Rs. 1 Lakh thus bringing the payable interest rate to zero. The scheme aims to encourage the financial inclusion and increase the scope of expansion of credit flow to rural areas, particularly to the farmers.
