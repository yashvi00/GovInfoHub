Bihar Mukhymantri Vaas Sthal Kray Sahayata Yojana (MVSKSY)
Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana Gramin (PMAY-G) is providing financial assistance of Rs. 1,20,000 to the rural people for construction of new homes. But some people belonging to SC / ST / OBC category does not have the land to build their own homes. So they are deprived of availing the benefits of PMAY-G housing scheme. Govt. has prepared the complete list of such people from the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) 2011 data. 
Now the state govt. will provide an assistance of Rs. 60,000 to such SC / ST / OBC category people in order to enable them to purchase their own land. This would make them eligible to avail the benefits of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana Gramin and realize their dream of having their own house. Govt. will not charge any registration fees on the purchase of these lands.
