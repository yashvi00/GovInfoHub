Bihar Victim Compensation Scheme 2018 for Rape & Acid Attack VictimsBihar Victim Compensation Scheme 2014 for Rape and Acid Attack VictimsReferences
Cabinet Committee has approved the Bihar Victim Compensation Scheme 2018. Under this scheme, all the rape and acid attack victims in Bihar will get an increased compensation of Rs. 7 lakh from the existing Rs. 3 lakh. This decision is taken after the directions issued by the Union Home Ministry following the decision of honourable Supreme Court given in February 2016. 
Law department has proposed this Bihar Victim Compensation (Amendment) Scheme 2018. This scheme is the modified version of the previous Bihar Victim Compensation Scheme, 2014. In June 2018, Central Govt. and National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) jointly form a new policy offering Rs. 5 lakh for Rape and Rs. 7 lakh for Acid Attack Victims.
Central government had then asked the states to devise their compensation amount accordingly. So, this increment in the previous Victim Compensation Scheme has become imperative after amendment in the Centre’s Compensation Scheme on the lines of SC decision.
