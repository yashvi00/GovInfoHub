Implementation of Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) affordable housing scheme in Bihar has started with 4.76 lakh families to be covered by the end of March 31. Under the PMAY scheme, selection of the beneficiaries is being done on the basis of SECC-2011. The gram panchayat has to select and approve the beneficiaries based on the socio-economic census data.
