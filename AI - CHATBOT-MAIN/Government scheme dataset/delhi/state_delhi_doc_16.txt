All the developers would be required to develop group housing as per Master Plan of Delhi 2021. It has 15% of floor area ratio (FAR) for community service personnel and lower category housing. This economically weaker section (EWS) component would be over and above the permissible FAR.
The auction purchaser needs to complete EWS portion firstly and obtain occupancy certificate for this portion. This is to be done before getting occupancy certificate for remunerative portion. The developers must not handover possession of non-EWS flats to anyone before handing over EWS flats to DDA.
