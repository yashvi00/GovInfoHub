People living in JJ clusters are not eligible to make applications to get their name included in DDA database for homeless people. This DDA survey for homeless people is just for record but in future if any scheme is prepared to provide houses to poor, then people whose name is present in this list would be considered.
As per the reports, DDA is going to conduct this survey on the orders of Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. This survey would not only help in identifying homeless persons but will also reduce fraud cases occuring in house disbursal in PMAY housing scheme. The central govt. may provide new houses to these people under PM Awas Yojana Urban.
