Delhi SC / ST / OBC / Minority Vocational Training Scheme
The DSFDC corporation was not able to sponsor sufficient number of students to these 2 training institutes due to lower family income criteria. The committee setup by the govt. for SC / ST / OBC / Minority Vocational Training Scheme suggested that annual family income should be raised from existing Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 5 lakh. But the cabinet has raised the annual family income limit from Rs. 1 lakh to Rs. 3 lakh.
The DSFDC corporation is implementing Vocational Training Scheme to impart job oriented vocational courses. People belonging to target groups like SC / ST / OBC / Minority get this vocational training to develop their skills and knowledge in a particular trade. This makes them self reliant for wage employment as well as self employment.
