Central Govt. Role in Delhi Free Bus / Metro Ride Scheme
CM Arvind Kejriwal has put allegations on central govt. that center does not want this Free Metro / Bus Ride Scheme in Delhi is implemented. Initially, Delhi govt. told center not to increase prices of tickets while central govt. didn’t agree. Then state govt. told that it has 50:50 partnership in Delhi Metro and has asked central govt. to give 50-50 subsidy on raised prices, center didn’t agree. 
The state govt. of Delhi is going to bear the fare of free bus, metro ride scheme and it does not require any approval from the state government. The proposal to make Delhi Metro and DTC / Cluster bus rides free was made on 2 June 2019 to encourage women to use public transport.
The state govt. is not going to face any problems in implementation of free travel in DTC and Cluster buses run by DIMTS. However, it would be challenging to implement this fare scheme in Metro trains as central and Delhi govt. are 50:50 equity partners in DMRC.
