Delhi govt. has extended the scope of Doorstep Delivery Scheme (Phase 2) for delivery of public services at home to the citizens. Apart from the already existing 40 services, govt. will add 35 more government services in the second phase of doorstep delivery of services (Sarkar Aapke Dwaar) in Delhi. People can now simply call 1076, register their details and mobile sahayaks would come at their home to provide benefits of these total 75 services. 
Since the roll-out of Doorstep Delivery of Services across Delhi in January 2018, citizens have been seeking to avail public services in large numbers. Delhi govt. announces its decision to add another 35 facilities to the Doorstep Delivery Scheme by the end of this month. 
The list of new services which are going to be added to the doorstep delivery of services scheme was drawn up after consultations between the state govt. and the concerned departments.
