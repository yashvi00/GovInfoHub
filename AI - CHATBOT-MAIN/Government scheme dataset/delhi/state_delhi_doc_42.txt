This disease is curable and early treatment reduces most disabilities. So, to ensure proper medication, clothing and nutrition supply, govt. will now provide Rs. 3000 p.m to leprosy affected persons.
Delhi Cabinet has also approved the revision in financial assistance to resident welfare associations (RWAs) and NGOs. Now all RWAs and NGOs will get Rs. 2 lakh per acre (earlier 1 lakh per acre) for maintenance and development of parks which are registered with Delhi Parks and Gardens Society (DPGS).
