Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) will provide this basic facility.
Delhi govt. is keen to make use of Delhi Metro Card in several DTC buses as soon as possible.
For this reason, the state govt. has already resolved several issues of coordination and connectivity between DTC and DMRC.

Implementation of Mobility Card for Public Transport
This mobility Card project was proposed in the year 2010. Earlier the state govt. decided to launch this scheme in July 2016, but the implementation of the Mobility Card Project got delayed. Subsequently, the state govt. has carried out various trials to test the functioning of mobility cards in the DTC buses. 
Delhi govt. has tried this facility in Phase III project and now they are going to install a machine on their buses. Accordingly, now their systems are capable to accept the mobility cards. Henceforth, DTC will install several ETMs in the buses. This machine will read the cards and will also process the receipts.
