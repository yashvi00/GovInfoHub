DDA Housing Scheme 2016-2017 which was expected to be launched by the end of January 2017, has been delayed once again. The Delhi Development Authority has decided to launch the scheme by the end of February or in March. The delay in launch date has been caused due to lack of basic infrastructure like approach roads, water supply and streetlights in the housing complexes to be offered in the upcoming scheme.
DDA Housing Scheme 2016-2017
Delhi Development Authority is planning to launch the scheme by the end of February or in March for about 13500 flats at different locations. A majority of flats are located in Rohini and Narela. Delhi Development Authority offered about 25 thousand flats in its 2014 housing scheme but more than 10000 winners returned their flats because of the too small size of flats and lack of basic infrastructure.
To make the 2016 housing scheme a success, the authority has decided to first revamp the basic infrastructure facilities and then launch the scheme. The engineering department of the authority has been directed to prepare the plan and complete the work within the given time frame. It will take about 2-3 months to complete the work related to approach roads, streetlights etc in the housing complexes.

Learning from the high rejection rate in previous housing scheme, the Delhi Development Authority has decided to sell the returned flats at older rates and doing away with the 5 year lock in period. The authority has decided to first improve the basic facilities to attract a good response from the home seekers.
The applications for the scheme will be invited through online mode only. DDA Housing Scheme 2016-2017 has not been announced yet, complete detailed information would be available only after the launch.
