State-run Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL) will be distributing 9 Watt LED bulbs in the capital city from July onward. The LED (Light Emitting Diode) bulbs will be available to both the home consumers as well as to commercial entities at same rates.
Under the central Governments’s UJALA (Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LED’s for All), government will distribute 9 watt LED bulbs in Delhi at discounted prices.
Earlier, 7 Watt LED bulbs were being distributed under the scheme which will no longer be available for sale. The consumers who already bought these 7 watt LED bulbs and facing some issues can get those replaced from dedicated replacement centers.
