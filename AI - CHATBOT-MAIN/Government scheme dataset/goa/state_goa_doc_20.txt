The derailed Atal Adarsh Gram Vikas Yojana is all set to be back on track soon as per the announcement made by the Chief minister Laxmikant Parsekar. Under the scheme Netravali village in remote Sanguem was selected to be developed into a model village.
The chief minister was inaugurating the Netravali Mahotsav recently when he made announcement for successful implementation of the Atal Adarsh Gram Vikas Yojana. After successful completion of the project in Netravali village, the scheme will be implemented in other villages by turn. 
The scheme execution was neglected leading to its derailment but CM assured that the scheme will soon be revived. The state government will now take on board all villagers and stakeholders to ensure that the project achieves the desired level of success.

Several other ministers were also present at the event. At the concluding ceremony of the 3-day festival, South Goa MP Narendra Sawaikar, urged the villagers to cooperate with the authorities in making Netravali a model village.
Netravali village was selected by the government for developing it into a model self-sufficient village with a focus on community participation under the central governmentâ€™s Atal Adarsh Gram Yojana. Launched with much fanfare in 2013 and touted as the pet project of then chief minister Manohar Parrikar, it got grounded after facing some teething problems.
