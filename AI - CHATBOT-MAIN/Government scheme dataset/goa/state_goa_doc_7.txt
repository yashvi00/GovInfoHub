Goa govt. has raised incentives under Inter Caste Marriage Scheme by Rs. 1.5 lakh for registered couples. Any couple who is going to become married in which one of the spouse belongs to Scheduled Caste (SC) will now get Rs. 2.5 lakh as incentive. Previously, the state govt. was providing Rs. 1 lakh under Antar Jatiya Vivah Yojana (अंतरजातीय विवाह प्रोत्साहन योजना).
This encouragement amount would be given in order to promote the interest of people in marriage with a Dalit Girl / Boy. Moreover, the main focus is to put an end to caste system and bring social equality in the society. Only the couples who have registered their marriage would be able to take scheme benefits. 
Directorate of Social Welfare is going to implement this scheme. For this, every couple in which any one of spouse is Dalit will have to make claim for this amount at the concerned authority.
