Zero Interest Farm Loan Scheme
The scheme of providing farm loans at subsidized interest rates is already going on but the government has not issued any detailed guidelines about it.
However, once implemented, the scheme will prove to be of a great help for the state farmers. The scheme will further reduce the burden of interest from the farmers and will help them increase their income and eventually the income and living standard.
