After the official launch in Ballia, Uttar Pradesh on May 1 by PM Nerandra Modi, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana is all set to be launched in the state of Gujarat. The PMUY free LPG connection scheme will be launched by BJP chief Amit Shah and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on 15th May in Gujarat.
The launch event of the scheme will take place in tribal-dominated Dahod district in central Gujarat. The scheme is aimed to provide free LPG connections to 5 crore BPL households in the country. The 8000 crore scheme will be partly funded by the money saved in LPG subsidies through PM Modi’s “Give-it-Up” campaign. IN Gujarat alone, 4.40 Lakh people have chosen to give up the LPG subsidy after the appeal made by PM Narendra Modi.
Dahod district has the lowest percentage of LPG connections across the state, hence it has been selected for the launch ceremony of the Ujjwala Yojana.

Under the PMUY LPG scheme, the central government will provide a financial support of Rs. 1600/- for each LPG connection to BPL household. The cooking gas will not only help reduce the cost of cooking but also help protect health of women and children.
Under the Ujjwala LPG scheme, the subsidy amount of LPG cylinder refill will be transferred to the Jan Dhan bank account of the women beneficiary. The eligible applicants can apply for PM Ujjwala scheme by going to their nearest LPG distributor.
