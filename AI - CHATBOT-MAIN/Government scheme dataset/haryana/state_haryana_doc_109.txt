Automation of Fair Price Shops is a new initiative introduced by the state government of Haryana under which the state government would install automation systems in the fair price shops.
The automation of fair price shops would be achieved by provisioning of point of sale device at every fair price shop with connectivity to ensure Aadhaar-based biometric identification of the beneficiaries and online transactions of food grains and other commodities.
The automation will benefit 29.30 lakh poor families and 1.32 crore beneficiaries in the state.
