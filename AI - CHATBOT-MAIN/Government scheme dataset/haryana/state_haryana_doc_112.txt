Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) is all set to offer about 6200 residential plots in urban areas across the state. These plots will be offered in 15 new sectors to be launched within next 6 months.
The authority is planning to earn about Rs. 3000 Crores by selling these plots and overcome the financial crises. Along with the residential plots, hundreds of commercial plots will also be available in these sectors. The authority can make almost Rs. 100 Crores just by selling the registration forms for draw of plots.
Huda chief administrator Vikas Gupta has directed zonal administrators to launch the new sectors by six months. Below is the list of cities where new sectors will be launched.
