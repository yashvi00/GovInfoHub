Haryana Government has approved the proposal of a loan scheme for fruit and vegetable growers. The scheme will be aimed to help the groups formed by the vegetable and fruit growers to increase production. Improvement in storage, processing and marketing of the produce to generate better returns is also the aim of the scheme.
The scheme will provide financial assistance to the farmers to create better infrastructure for production, marketing, processing and storage of fruits and vegetables.
All the registered societies engaged in the cultivation, post-harvest management, processing and marketing of vegetables and fruits would be eligible for the loan under the scheme.
