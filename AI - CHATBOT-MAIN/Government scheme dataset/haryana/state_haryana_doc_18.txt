Haryana Youth Job Incentive Scheme 2019
The state govt. of Haryana wants that all big and medium industries (block A & B) would provide job opportunities to local youths. These companies will be given incentive of Rs. 3,000 for next 3 years on employment of local candidates. This scheme would encourage companies to firstly consider and explore the educational qualification and talent of local candidates. 
Similar type of scheme is already running in other states like Madhya Pradesh. However there would be no governmental pressure on any company to recruit local youths, this scheme is just for encouragement. The state govt. of Haryana is preparing a separate scheme for this purpose and will implement it soon.
