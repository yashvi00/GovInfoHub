Haryana Paudhagiri Abhiyan – How to Earn Money / Awards
Paudhagiri is an initiative by the govt. to increase the green cover in Haryana. Under this initiative, the government would distribute saplings to school students and motivating them to nurture the plant and ensure that it grows into a tree. Students will be awarded Rs. 50 every 6 months for upcoming 3 years for surviving saplings.
Thus each student can plant any number of trees and get Rs. 50 on each tree. Accordingly, the larger the number of trees, the larger would be the amount which would enable students to earn money.
