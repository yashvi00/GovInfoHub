Haryana government has decided to provide 44,000 agriculture pump connections to farmers in the next 6 months. All the farmers whose tube well connections are pending since 1 January 2014 will be issued agricultural pump connections. The state govt. will issue demand notices for all the pending tube well connections by 31 March 2019.
The state govt. has set a target to issue 50,000 new solar energy connections in the state and out of this, tenders have been floated already for 15,000 connections. Usage of solar energy in tube wells reduces the entire power connection by about 30%. 
Around 468 agricultural tube wells under the Vayama Feeder of Karnal block and Saspur Feeder of Yamunanagar block would run on solar energy at an estimated cost of about Rs 25 crore.

For the first time in the state, all the 4 power companies have emerged from losses and have earned profit. In 2017-18, UHBVN earns a profit of Rs. 278 crore and DHBVN earns profit of Rs. 134 crore. Thus the total earned profits of these 2 companies is Rs. 412 crore. To ensure welfare of farmers, the power tariff has been reduced to almost half (50%). This reduction has considerably resulted in reducing the electricity bills of domestic consumers.
There were a total number of 54,08,722 electricity connections in Haryana in FY 2014. The state govt. has issued 10,87,835 new connections during the last 4 years. Out of these, around 4,48,588 connections were given to un-electrified households in the rural area.
As the Assembly elections (scheduled in Oct 2019) and Lok Sabha elections (scheduled in May 2019) dates are coming, so the state govt. wants to lure farmers.
