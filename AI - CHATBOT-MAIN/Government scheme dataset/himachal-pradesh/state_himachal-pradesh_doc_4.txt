Himachal Pradesh government has started a new HP Single Use Plastic Buy Back Scheme 2019. Under this scheme, the state govt. will buyback single-use, non-recyclable plastic waste with a minimum support price of Rs. 75 per kg. This scheme is started by CM Jai Ram Thakur at a function held on 2 October 2019 to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
As per initial estimates, the total plastic which is likely to be collected will be about 75,000 kg. The budget required for plastic buy back is around Rs. 2.81 crore. The non-recyclable waste will include polythene bags and govt. will purchase this waste from rag-pickers, households and urban local bodies (ULBs).
Since 2 October 2009, there has been a complete ban on the use of polythene bags in Himachal Pradesh state. The HP single-use plastic buyback scheme got the cabinet approval on 16 September 2019.

At a function organized here to celebrate the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, CM said that single use plastic (disposable) is not only an environment hazard but also a health threat for humans and animals. 
This scheme will encourage people to use environment-friendly bags instead of polythene. HP state govt. has already imposed ban on usage of plastic bags and cutlery made of plastic and thermocol. Jute bags are an alternative to plastic bags.

There is a need to adopt Gandhiji’s humanistic message and ideology in life. This year, the state govt. celebrates 150th birth anniversary of Father of Nation as “Swachhata Hi Seva” campaign. On 2 October 2019, the state govt. also celebrates the day to perform “Shramdaan” to eradicate plastic waste.
Himachal Pradesh is the first state to tackle the threat of plastic and other non-biodegradable waste. The polythene waste collected through various awareness campaigns would be used as an alternative in road construction and as fuel in cement kilns.
