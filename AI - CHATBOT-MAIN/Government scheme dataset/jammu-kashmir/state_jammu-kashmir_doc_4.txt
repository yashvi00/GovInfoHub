J&K has secured 1st position in the country on account of high reduction in the infant mortality rate (IMR) in a single year. This also accounts to provide better healthcare facilities to the rural population of the state. AB-PMJAY is a flagship scheme of the Modi govt. launched on 23 September 2018 to improve and strengthen healthcare at all levels.
