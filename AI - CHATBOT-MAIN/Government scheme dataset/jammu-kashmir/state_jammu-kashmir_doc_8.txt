Details of Muhafiz (Guardian) Scheme
The important features and highlights of this scheme are as follows:-

Under Guardian Scheme, the workers who are registered with JKBOCWWB will get socio-economic security and an insurance coverage.
Initially, the credit facility limit will remain Rs. 10,000 along with a counter guarantee.
For this reason, JKBOCWWB will deposit Rs. 30 crore in the J&K Bank.
Moreover, govt. will also provide educational scholarships for the children of labourers.
This scheme will benefit around 3 lakh workers of unorganized sector especially from rural areas.
Furthermore, JKBOCWWB has also provided financial assistance of Rs. 275 crore for education, marriage, chronic diseases etc. in the previous 3 years to such workers.

Govt. is going to start this scheme because unorganized sector consists of the wage paid labourers. Subsequently, they have seasonal nature of employment and also their enterprises have scattered locations. Accordingly, workers have low income, unstable jobs, lack of protection from various legislations or trade unions. So J&K govt. is going to launch this scheme.
