Generally students have to move away from their homes to avail better study facilities in order to carry on their preparation for the civil services examination. So, all the bright candidates who have already cracked PT (preliminary test) of UPSC civil services exam will not have to think about expenses rather they must focus on the preparation for their Mains examination.
