Mukhyamantri Swasthya Beema Yojana (MSBY) is a new health insurance scheme in the state of Jharkhand which will be launched on 15th November 2017. The state government of Jharkhand will implement the Swasthya Beema Yojana from 28th December 2017 to provide health insurance coverage to the state residents.
The government is preparing to launch the Chief Minister Health Insurance Scheme on 15th November. The scheme will provide benefits to about 57 lakh families in the state who are covered under the National Food Security Act. The government would provide free and cashless treatment to the poor families under the scheme.
The government may not take any premium from the poor people of the state and bear the full premium. The treatment under the Mukhyamantri Swasthya Beema Yojana would be available at all the government hospitals and empaneled private health institutions. The government will also enlist the popular and well-known hospitals and nursing homes at its border line and neighboring states for free and cashless treatment under the scheme.
