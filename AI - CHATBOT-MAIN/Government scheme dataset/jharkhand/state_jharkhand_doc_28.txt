The state government of Jharkhand is planning to launch a new scheme to attract rural youth in agriculture. The scheme named as “ARYA” – Attracting Rural Youth in Agriculture will be launched by the Chief Minister Raghubar Das soon.
The objective of the ARYA scheme will be to promote the green revolution in the state. Under the ARYA scheme, the state government will attract rural youth in agriculture by making them skilled and make the state self-dependent in agriculture.
Under the scheme, Agriculture Technology Management and Training (ATMA) will provide the training to the rural youth. From each village, two youths will be selected and trained on how to make the proper use of barren and uncultivated land and inspired to grow pulses.
