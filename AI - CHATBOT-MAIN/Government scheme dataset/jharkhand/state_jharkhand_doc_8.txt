Jharkhand govt. has announced to provide Interest Free Farm Loans at zero percent interest rate to farmers. The state govt. is going to bear the entire interest of upto 1 year. The only condition is that the farmers must pay back the loan in 1 year. This announcement was made by the Mukhyamantri at Global Agriculture and Food Summit 2018 in Ranchi, Jharkhand.
CM also said that 50% subsidy would be given in the dairy sector to promote white revolution in the state. So, women must form SHGs and start dairy farming. Farmers must not depend on agriculture alone rather they should divide farming into 3 parts – cultivation, cattle rearing for dairy and solar farming on barren land. 
These measures could raise the income of the farmers to upto 4 times. Moreover by the month of May 2019, a separate feeder line would be created for farmers.
