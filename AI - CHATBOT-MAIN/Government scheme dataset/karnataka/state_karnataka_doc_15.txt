SC / ST students who have cleared Graduate Record Examinations (GRE), Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), Scholastic Aptitude / Assessment Test (SAT) and other qualifying examinations are eligible for Prabuddha Scheme.
Background for Prabhudha Scheme
Though there was funding for SC/ST students to study abroad since 2001, only 287 students have availed benefits till 2018. This is because the students with 49% to 51% score in qualifying exams like GRE / GMAT / SAT were funded. The state government had spent around Rs. 58 crore under the Prabuddha scheme so far. This is a pioneering move and the Prabhudha scheme will enable students from depressed classes to realize their dream.
Access to education for SC / ST is limited due to lack of funds and social pressures. With this Prabuddha scheme, govt. wants that more students can avail scheme benefit and contribute towards improving their own lives as well as the communities from where they comes from and of the entire state.
The scholarship funds would be distributed equally to ensure that the scheme remains fair and transparent to all applicants. A student is eligible to apply for the scheme for 1 time only whether it is for UG, PG or PhD courses. From a single family, maximum 2 students can apply for the scholarship scheme. This scheme will realize the dream of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar of an enlightened India, Prabhuddha Bharat and would enable students to broaden their horizons for the betterment of the society.
