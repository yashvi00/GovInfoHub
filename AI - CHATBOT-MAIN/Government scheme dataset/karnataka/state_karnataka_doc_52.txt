The state government of Karnataka is all set to launch a new scheme for integrated development of selected villages in the state. Named as “Mukhya Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (CMAGY)”, the scheme would be rolled out on the lines of central government’s flagship “Pradhan Mantri Sansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (PMAGY)” scheme.
Objective of Mukhya Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana
Integrated development of selected villages in the state is the core objective of CMAGY. The scheme aims to provide all physical and social infrastructure to these villages for their all round socio-economic development.
The scheme would also target elimination of disparity between SCs and other communities when it comes to common socio-economic indicators such as literacy rate, elementary education, infant mortality rate/maternal mortality rate and ownership of productive assets.

Mukhya Mantri Adarsh Gram Yojana (CMAGY) – Facts & Figures
Under the scheme, the state government aims to convert about 150 villages into “Adarsh Grams” (Model Villages). Karnataka government would develop at least 100 villages having a higher ratio (over 50%) of people belonging to the Scheduled Castes and 50 villages having higher ratio (over 50 %) of people belonging to Scheduled Tribe.
The state government has planned to fund each village by Rs. 1 Crore along with a total of 40 Crore released by central government under PMAGY for this financial year. Overall, the final figures would be about Rs. 3 Crore per village as the govt. plans to draw funds from several departments allocated for various social welfare scheme for SC/ST’s.
