State Government of Karnataka is all set to launch a new scheme under the Bhagya schemes Outlay to provide free LPG connections to the women belonging to BPL households. The Karnataka government, under the Gas Bhagya scheme will provide a cooking stove and a domestic LPG connection to women members of each below poverty line (BPL) family.
The state government is also keen to implement the recently announced Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana by sharing the cost with Centre.
The Gas Bhagya scheme is expected to benefit about 40% of almost 1 Crore BPL families who use karosene, firewood, crop residue or cowdung cake to cook food.

Karnataka Government had earlier launched such scheme to distribute the free LPG connections to those who get their quota of Karosene from fair price shops. But, under the new Gas Bhagya scheme, free LPG connections will be given to those relying on firewood, crop residue or cowdung cake to cook.
The Gas Bhagya scheme is expected to be launched soon, however no exact date has been mentioned yet.
