Project LIFE – Livelihood, Inclusion, Financial Empowerment, an ambitious mission of the state government of Kerala has been announced. The mission is to provide homes to 2 Lakh homeless families in the state within next 5 years through a comprehensive housing scheme.
The project was announced by the Chief Minister of Kerala two days after the CPM-led government completed 100 days in power. The mission is not just to provide homes to the homeless but also to provide the occupants with opportunities to integrate with the mainstream by bringing in social security schemes.
The government, under the Project LIFE would construct homes by keeping in mind the sensitivity of acquiring land the scarcity in the state.

The government would also ensure facilities such as power supply & backup, water supply, sanitation facilities, cooking fuel and other amenities are being taken care of in the complexes.
