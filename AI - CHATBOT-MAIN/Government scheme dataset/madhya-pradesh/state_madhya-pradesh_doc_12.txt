Madhya Pradesh govt. has started Selfie With Toilet Scheme 2019 under Mukhyamantri Kanya Vivah / Nikah Yojana. Under this scheme, if groom takes a loo selfie then bride will get Rs. 51,000 as marriage gift. This is one pre wedding photo shoot which no one wants to remember. Application forms for MP CM Kanya Vivaah / Nikaah Scheme would be accepted only after the bride proves that her husband’s house has a toilet.
It is now a mandatory requirement to take Selfie With Toilet to avail assistance of Rs. 51,000 under CM Kanya Vivah / Nikah Yojana in MP. As govt. officials cannot go to each house and check loos everywhere, they now demands #selfie-standing-in-toilet from groom. 
The idea of grooms being required to prove that they have toilet before marrying is not bad thing. Social Justice department has not issued any such directive and implementation of policy can be better.

MP Selfie With Toilet Scheme – CM Kanya Vivah / Nikah Yojana
The clause of Toilet is present since the launch of MP Mukhyamantri Kanya Vivah / Nikah Yojana in 2013 but photographs are recent addition. Previously, there was relaxation in policy and grooms were told to build a toilet within 30 days of marriage. But now the Selfie With Toilet Scheme is compulsory for all grooms and brides to avail Rs. 51,000 as marriage gift.
There is nothing wrong in attaching photo of groom in toilet as it is not a part of wedding card. This case gets worse in case the bride lives in another city or district. The local govt. officials did not approves the marriage till groom provided proof of him standing in toilet. The toilets are an intrinsic part of Swachh Bharat Mission of central government.

The grooms are at receiving end of this cleanup mission and there could be some more graceful way of asking grooms to prove they have toilets.
MP Selfie With Toilet Scheme Bride Groom
MP Mukhyamantri Kanya Vivah / Nikah Scheme is applicable for economically weaker sections (EWS) category people. On 18 December 2018, the state govt. led by CM Kamal Nath had hiked financial assistance from Rs. 28,000 to Rs. 51,000. This has led to a large number of applications which makes it difficult for officials to access each house for toilets.
