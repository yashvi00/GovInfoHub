Samarth Sangini Yojana â€“ Women Safety
Aimed at checking the safety of women in the state, police department would assign the post of nodal officers to additional superintendent of police/deputy superintendent of police. The scheme will allow all women to go ahead a report the crime against them including incidents of molestation, rape and domestic violence, which they often avoid.
