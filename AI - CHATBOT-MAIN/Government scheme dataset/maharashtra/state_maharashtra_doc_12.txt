Food & Civil Supplies Department is expected to implement this scheme for BPL ration card holders from 14 districts where farmers suicide rate is highest. There are around 40.98 lakh PMUY gas connections and around 80% may have ordered a refill. 
Even the PM Ujjwala Yojana was widely famous, the refill rate is very low. Most of the beneficiaries after getting gas connections are unable to continue using LPG as a medium for cooking due to high cost of refill.
