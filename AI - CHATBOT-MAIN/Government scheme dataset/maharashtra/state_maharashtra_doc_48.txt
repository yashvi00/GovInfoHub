The Maharashtra state govt. is planning to introduce “Direct Benefit Transfer Portal” (DBT) to collect the data from farmers regarding their loan. The farmers can register themselves on the portal and they have to fill all details for their loan waiver.
The Maharashtra DBT portal is aimed at ensuring simpler and faster flow of funds to genuine beneficiaries and cut frauds. The new DBT portal would be developed on the lines of existing central portal. Recently, the farmers’ agitation in Maharashtra was demanding for mercy on their loan. The state govt. has announced over Rs. 36,000 crore loan waiver to relief the farmers.
Objective of DBT Portal
The objective of DBT portal would be to cover all farmers in the state and provide a relief from the burden of loan and increase their income.
