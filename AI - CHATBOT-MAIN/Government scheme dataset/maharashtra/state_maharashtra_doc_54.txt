The revamped mega health insurance scheme of state government of Maharashtra has been re-scheduled to launch on 21st October. Rajiv Gandhi Jeevandayee Arogya Yojana (RGJAY), which was revamped as the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY) in August, was scheduled to be launched last Saturday but the deadline has been missed.
The reasons of the delay are some technical and administrative reasons as reported by the asianage.com.
Under the revamped Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY) will provide insurance for over 1100 ailments instead of 900, as was the case in the earlier scheme.

However, the doctors in the state civil hospitals are still working as per the older RGJAY scheme.
The complete details about the scheme would be available once the scheme is launched.
