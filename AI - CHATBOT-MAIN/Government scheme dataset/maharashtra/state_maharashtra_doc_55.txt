State Government of Maharashtra has announced a new scheme named “Bal Thackeray Upgath Vima Yojana”. The scheme aimed to help road accident victims get instant treatment at the trauma care hospitals across the state.
Under the Bal Thackeray Upgath Vima Yojana, the accident victims will be treated for free in trauma care hospitals for up to 3 days. The state government will cover the cost of treatment of up to Rs. 30,000/-.
This is the fist time such a scheme has been launched in the state of Maharashtra in the name of late Shiv Sena leader Bal Thackeray. Such a scheme is currently in operation in Tamil Nadu.
