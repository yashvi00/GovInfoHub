Maharashtra government is going to change the eligibility criteria to “One Family One House” for beneficiaries in government housing schemes. This rule is being changed as an aftermath of the Bombay High Court order. Now under One Family One House Scheme, a person will not be eligible to get a flat in a government scheme if he or his immediate family has previously been allotted a flat anywhere in Maharashtra.
In the FY 2018, Bombay High Court was hearing a plea that no other house will be allotted to a beneficiary if he has already 1 under govt. housing scheme. In this One Family One House scheme, a person and immediate family will only have 1 house anywhere in the state.
This rule will even apply in case the beneficiary is a judge or a bureaucrat. The challenge in HC was to an allotment made to a society of sitting HC judges in the suburbs of Mumbai.

This norm will remain applicable to the beneficiary immediate family such as wife or dependent child to ensure that ineligible beneficiary does not get second house in name of family member. It is still not known that whether norm is applicable for free-housing rehabilitation schemes or not. 
The state govt. is seeking advice of law department on whether norm should also apply to rehabilitation schemes. In this schemes, govt. provides buildable area incentives in lieu of free rehabilitation of occupiers.
