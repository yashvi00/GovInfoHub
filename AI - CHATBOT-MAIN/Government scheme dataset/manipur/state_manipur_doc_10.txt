The selection of the beneficiaries for Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Gramin is being done on the basis of SECC-2011 data considering several factors and validating those through gram sabha.
PMAY-G also provides a provision of a loan of up to Rs. 70000 for further extension of the house. A loan of up to Rs. 2 Lakh taken in 2017 for new home construction or extension will receive an interest subvention of 3% resulting in significant less burden of interest and less EMI’s for the borrowers.
