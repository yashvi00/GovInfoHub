The state government of Odisha is all set to launch a new housing scheme named “Nirman Shramik Pucca Ghar Yojana” for the construction workers in the state. The new housing scheme will be launched on 20th February 2016, a day before the proposed rally of Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi.
The construction workers who have registered with the Odisha Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board (OBOCWWB) for more than 5 years and not availed houses under any housing schemes would be the beneficiaries of the scheme.
Under the scheme, the state government will provide Rs. 1 Lakh to each construction worker. The money would be provided to Panchayati Raj department by the labour department and then will be distributed among the eligible genuine beneficiaries of the scheme.
