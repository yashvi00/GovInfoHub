Odisha govt. is going to introduce its new Food Security Scheme 2018 in the state. This scheme will cover an additional 34.44 lakh people who are previously left out from the National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013. The state govt. will start implementing this scheme from 2 October 2018 (Gandhi Jayanti).
After the implementation of Food Security Scheme, not a single poor person would be left out and deprived of their rights of food security. NFSA is being implemented on the basis of 2011 Census and total number of beneficiaries is increased in the recent years.
Previously, CM has taken up this matter with the PM Narendra Modi but this issue was not addressed and no further steps were taken to resolve this issue. So, govt. is now going to implement its own Food Security Scheme.

Odisha Food Security Scheme 2018
Central govt. is implementing National Food Security Act (NFSA) as per the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC-2011) Data. A large number of poor people whose name does not appears in SECC-2011 Data are deprived of the food security benefits. Accordingly, the state govt. has decided to roll-out its own Food Security Scheme 2018 for all those whose name is not present in the NFSA beneficiary list. 
As per the official data, there are more than 34 lakh beneficiaries who are not included in NFSA. For these, govt. will implement new Food Security Act from 2 October 2018. CM has made this announcement while addressing a video conference under ‘Ama Mukhyamantri, Ama Katha’ program held on 28 July 2018.

Odisha state government is giving importance to food security. The state govt. is providing Rice at Rs. 2 per kg since 2008. The successful implementation of this prompts govt. to provide Rice at Rs. 1 to poor families. So, govt. is providing rice at Rs. 1 per kg after 2013. It has been a milestone in food security in the entire country.
Need for Odisha Food Security Act, 2018
The total population of state is around 4.19 crore. Odisha govt. is implementing NFSA from November 2015. Out of total population, around 3.26 crore people (78% of total population) are already covered under NFSA. Now the state govt. wants to tweak Odisha Food Security Rules 2017 to add 34.44 lakh more beneficiaries. 
There are provisions in the rules which empowers the state govt. to expand the scope of coverage. Odisha govt. aims to cover 3.6 crore beneficiaries under the NFSA.
