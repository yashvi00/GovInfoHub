Odisha govt. has taken various steps to fill up vacancies of teaching in staff in colleges. The students in Odisha are more inclined towards private colleges owing to large-scale vacancies in teaching staff and lack of infrastructure in government colleges. The main focus of the state govt. is on improving the overall quality of teaching. 
Moreover, govt. will lay stress on the need of reorientation in teaching of history. Now the local heroes like Rana Pratap Singh would be given more importance over outsiders like Babar and Akbar. The state govt. has also decided that Sambalpur University must be trifurcated with two more universities at Bhawanipatna and Balangir.
