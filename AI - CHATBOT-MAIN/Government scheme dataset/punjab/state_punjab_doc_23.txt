Doubling Freedom Fighters Pension in Punjab
Increasing the monthly pension of Freedom Fighters from Rs. 7500 to Rs. 15,000 is a long term demand. So, the state govt. has forwarded this proposal to the finance department for approval. The need for this step is felt as the central govt. is providing more amount of monthly pension under the Swatantrata Sainik Samman Yojana:-

Rs. 30,900 per month as pension to ex-Andaman political prisoners or spouses.
Rs. 28,840 to freedom fighters who suffered outside British India or spouses.
Rs. 26,780 to other freedom fighters or spouses including Indian National Army (INA).

Moreover under this central govt. pension scheme, dependent parents or eligible daughters (maximum 3 daughters) are also paid 50% of the sum of the total monthly pension which would have to be given to the Freedom fighters i.e between Rs. 13,390 to Rs. 15,450.

Central govt. also provides free railway passes to these freedom fighters and their spouses in addition to a companion for lifetime. They can make free travel to any part of the country for any number of times during their entire life. Freedom fighters also get free medical assistance and other treatment facilities under Central govt. Health Scheme (CGHS). 
Free treatment is also provided at any hospitals run by public sector undertakings. This free treatment is applicable to hospitals under the control of dept. of public enterprises to the freedom fighters and their dependents. Freedom fighters are also allowed to avail a telephone connection without any installation charges and only at paying half the rental amount.
