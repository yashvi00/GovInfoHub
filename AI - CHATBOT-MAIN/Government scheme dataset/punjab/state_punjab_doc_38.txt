The scheme would also boost the number of admissions in government engineering colleges and polytechnics across the state. Until now, the number of admissions in these government run colleges have been very low and many seats remain vacant every year. Since the scheme would provide tuition fee waiver, it will definitely attract admissions in these colleges/institutions.
