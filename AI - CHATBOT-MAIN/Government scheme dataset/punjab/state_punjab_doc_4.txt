Punjab government has launched a mega health insurance scheme namely Mahatma Gandhi Sarbat Sehat Bima Yojana (MGSSBY). In this scheme, the state govt. has merged Ayushman Bharat or Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) with its own Sarbat Sehat Bima Yojana (SSBY). This scheme will provide cashless treatment upto Rs. 5 lakh in all public and empanelled private hospitals. 
The central govt’s flagship PMJAY scheme was launched in September 2018 by PM Modi and has been kept on hold so far by Punjab government. CM Captain Amarinder Singh has launched MGSSBY scheme on 75th anniversary of former PM Rajiv Gandhi. 
Around 46 lakh families (76% of Punjab population) would be covered under this MGSSBY scheme which makes its 1st state to offer medical insurance to such a large proportion of population.
