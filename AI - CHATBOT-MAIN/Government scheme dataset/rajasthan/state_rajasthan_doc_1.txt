In that particular housing scheme, around 346 plots are proposed to be developed. The civic body has received over 42,000 applications so far. The lottery for the scheme will be held on February 5.

The plots, sized between 45 square metre to 220 square metre, will be developed in the colony. It is situated on the 200-Feet Road connecting Muhana and Gopalpura Road.
