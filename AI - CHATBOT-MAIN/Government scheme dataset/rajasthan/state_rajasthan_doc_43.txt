State government is taking several measures to increase the credit flow and bringing more farmers including small and marginal farmers within financial inclusion. The farmers will be evaluated on the basis of the market value of the product kept by them, whichever is less and 70 percent of the amount will be made available as a loan.
Since the farmers do not have a regular monthly income, the government is taking several initiatives to provide financial assistance to farmers in the times of crises. Under Krishi Upaj Rahan Loan Scheme, state government would provide loan at subsidized rates of interest to provide a better life to the farmers of the state.
