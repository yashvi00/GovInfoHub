Tamil Nadu govt. is planning to introduce Samadhan scheme to resolve the long-pending arrears of commercial taxes related issues. This scheme would be introduced by The commercial taxes and Registration department. This scheme will improve the efficiency of state govt.
The introduction of GST from July 1 necessitated the Samadhan scheme to collect the long pending cases. The issues calculated are around 1000 crore as per the official sources. The government might consider giving some exemption to parties and concerns to encourage the settling dues.
There are many cases that are pending in courts and at various levels in the department due to dispute over the tax amount. These disputes would be resolved under the scheme. It has become necessary for the state to resolve the tax related issues after the introduction of GST (Goods and Services Tax).
