Tripura government is soon going to launch a new healthcare scheme on lines of Ayushman Bharat – PM Jan Arogya Yojana. The new scheme will be named as Ayushman Tripura Scheme & will provide cashless and paperless treatment upto Rs. 5 lakh. Poor people will get this free of cost treatment at all government and private empanelled hospitals.
Ayushman Tripura Scheme would cover 3.57 lakh persons and issuance of cards to the beneficiaries would cost the state exchequer around Rs. 9 crores. Poor people will be either benefited by the Ayushman Bharat Scheme or Ayushman Tripura. As the Ayushman Bharat Scheme only covers those whose name is present in SECC 2011 data but this scheme will cover all poor people.
The state govt. will introduce Ayushman Tripura Scheme soon where poor people will not have to pay anything to avail treatment.
