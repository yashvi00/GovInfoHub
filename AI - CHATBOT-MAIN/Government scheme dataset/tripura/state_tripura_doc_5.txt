Scheme to Distribute Cows to 5000 Families in Tripura
The state govt. of Tripura has decided to provide 10,000 cows to around 5000 poor families in the state. The primary objective of this scheme is to make the state self sufficient in the production of milk and dairy products. CM will start domestication of cows at CM’s residence along with his family and will consume its milk to inspire other people for the same purpose of domestication of cows.
CM said that a scheme to distribute 2 cows each to poor families would soon be launched. CM clarifies that he is not against the setting up of industries but in that task, the investment is very high. One has to invest approx. Rs. 10,000 (Rs. 100 billion) for employing 2,000 people. But in case the state govt. has given 10,000 cows to 5,000 families, then they would start earning in the next 6 months.
