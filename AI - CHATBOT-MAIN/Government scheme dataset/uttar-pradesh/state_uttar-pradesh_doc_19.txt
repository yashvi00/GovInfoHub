Each such animal which is adopted would be ear-tagged for identity purposes under UP CM Destitute Cow Participation Scheme. Earlier in 2019, farmers in UP had taken up arms and protested over stray cattle destroying their fields. This is an aftermath of decision of ban on illegal slaughter of cattle in Uttar Pradesh.
There were various instances of farmers locking up stray cattle in govt. schools and offices which led to UP govt. to order opening of new cow shelters in every district. The UP govt. is paying Rs. 900 every month to upkeep each cattle to cow shelters too.

Yogi Govt. to Pay Rs. 30 / Day on Adopting Stray Cattle
As the cow shelters are overflowing with more than 10 to 12 lakh cattle and there are reports of cows dying due to neglect. So, UP govt. has approved a new Chief Minister Destitute Cow Participation Scheme. In this scheme, all the willing farmers, dairy farmers or common people can adopt a cow from existing shelters and take animal home.
In the 1st phase of adopting stray cattle scheme, govt. will hand over 1 lakh cattle to such members of public. UP govt. is going to transfer Rs. 900 per month to bank account of each such farmer for up-keep and nutrition of animal. The District Magistrates are going to identify such “willing adopters”.

The state govt. of Uttar Pradesh will spend Rs. 109 crore on this exercise annually. In order to avail the scheme benefits, person who adopts the animal cannot sell or let loose / abandon the animal. The UP govt. will setup committee in each district to monitor exercise and each such animal handed over would be ear tagged. This ear tagging is to be done for identity and subsequent monitoring.
The UP government has the “potential to create employment and increase social participation”. This would increase the income of farmers and would reduce the extent of stray cattle in UP. In the subsequent phases, more cow can be put up for adoption depending upon initial success.
