The state government of Uttar Pradesh is planning to construct 10 lakh houses in rural areas under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana Gramin (PMAY-G) and 2 lakh houses in urban areas under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana – Urban (PMAY-U). The aim of the central government’s flagship housing scheme is to provide shelter for homeless people across the country.
According to the official data, around 48 lakh people in the rural areas of Uttar Pradesh do not have a permanent residence to stay. So the state government is planning to solve this problem by constructing at least 10 lakh houses in the state within 2017-18 under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana Gramin. PMAY is a central government’s scheme under which an affordable house to poor and homeless people in the country would be provided through several benefit components of the scheme.
