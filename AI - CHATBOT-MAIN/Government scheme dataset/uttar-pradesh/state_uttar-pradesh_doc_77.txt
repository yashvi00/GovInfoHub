Free Housing Scheme for Poor in UP
Yogi government wants not one to live without home and rehabilitation for people living in slums. Since the people who do not have enough money to buy food, it is impossible for them to afford a home. Hence, the Yogi Adityanath Government has decided to provide free housing to such poor homeless families.
Chief Minister Yogi, who is also the housing minister has started working along with the officers of the department to prepare the proposal for free housing for poor. According to the Housing and Urban Planning Department, the state government would soon launch a new housing scheme for poor similar to housing schemes in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra. A meeting with the officials from all the concerned departments would be held on 25th of April where the decision of launching the scheme can be taken.
