Despite financial burden, the state govt. starts these 2 new schemes for the welfare of farmers. Moreover, the state govt. has also waived tax on the agricultural land belonging to farmers. Currently, the state govt. is paying around 80% while central govt. pays only 20% of the insurance payout to provide crop insurance to farmers.
