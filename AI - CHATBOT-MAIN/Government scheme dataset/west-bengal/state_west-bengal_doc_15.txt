WB Janamanashe Mental Health Awareness Scheme
Specially trained women from SHGs and various mental health specialists would run this mental health awareness scheme. They will make visits house to house and chat with the family members as most of the people are not keen to discuss about their mental status or admit to have mental problems. 
This chatting will enable the women to know about the mental health of the residents and to identify any problem that may exist. A database of residents is going to be created which will enable counselling of people to make them aware of the need for treatment.

Now, here is the second part of the work under Janamanashe Mental Health Awareness Scheme. On certain days, govt. will organize various sessions at municipal buildings under mental health specialists. It can be the lack of attention in children for one day while it would be constant unwillingness to work on other day.
