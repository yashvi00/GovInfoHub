West Bengal Bangla Krishi Sech Yojana for Farmers
Drip irrigation and Sprinkle irrigation are 2 important processes which will help in cultivation of more acres of land using less quantity of water. Various trials and tests proves that both these processes are helpful in cultivation of crops with lesser water consumption. CM Mamata Banerjee has received the proposal for this purpose which has now been approved in the cabinet on 12 September 2018.
It is important to note that Small & Marginal Farmers can’t bear the cost of drip irrigation and sprinkle irrigation mechanisms. Drip Irrigation mechanism costs around Rs. 70,000 and Sprinkle Irrigation mechanism will cost around Rs. 20,000 per acre of land. Farmers will get these facilities absolutely free of cost. The state govt. has allocated around Rs. 35 crore for the project.
