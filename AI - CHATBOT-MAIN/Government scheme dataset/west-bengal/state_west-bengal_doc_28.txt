One of the most ambitious scheme of Narendra Modi Government, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana is all set to be launched in West Bengal on Sunday, 14th August. Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan would launch PMUY LPG scheme in Kolkata to target 1.06 Crore BPL households in the state.
LPG penetration in the state is even less than the national average of 52%, hence the state is the next destination to be covered under the Ujjwala Yojana. Launched on 1st May, the scheme is entitled to provide free LPG connections to women belonging to BPL households as per the Socio Economic Caste Census data of 2011.
To mark the launch of the LPG scheme, Ujjwala melas will be organized at LPG distributorships across the state between 15-17 August for distributing LPG connections to identified beneficiaries.

The government has earmarked Rs. 8000 Crores for distribution of free LPG connections to 5 Crore BPL households across the country.
