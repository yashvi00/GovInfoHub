The TMC party leaders will visit villages to boost morale of booth workers, influential people in the area. Moreover, these leaders will listen to those people who voice grievances or raise concerns.
The BJP’s rise in Bengal is a grave concern for the TMC party, especially after its resounding win in the general elections, where it won 18 of 42 seats. The Trinamool lost 12 seats and bagged only 22, so CM wants to raise its tally to the previous number or even more than that.
CM Mamata Banerjee is ready to fight back and make comeback by targeting to win back her rural support by resolving the issues of extortion at the local level and corruptions. She had also urged party leaders to get down to the block level and work for the people.
